# H1 ClouderaDataExplorer_v2
Bardess coded updated build of CDE.

This is the "GA" of the Cloudera Data Explorer based off the Data Concierge platform developed by Dennis Jaskowiak and Qlik DACH SA team.

Philip Corr of Bardess rebuilt the code to enhance user viability and create guardrails for user interaction. The application is powered by the Cloudera Data Catalog developed by Dave Freriks. The data catalog collects and associates metadata from Impala, Cloudera Navigator, and Cloudera Navigator.

This software is released "AS-IS", but welcome improvements to the base code as there are many cool things that could be added to this concept.
